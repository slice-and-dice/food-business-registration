				Register a food business
			</h1>
			<p>
				All food businesses which regularly produce or serve food to the public need to be registered with their Local Authority.
				This service will capture registration information and send it to the correct local authority based on your trading location.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please answer these questions to the best of your abilities.
			</p>

			<p>
				During this registration, you may come across a few specialist terms, which we have described below:
			</p>
			<p>
				• A food business operator is the person, charity or company who makes the decisions about the food business, what it serves
				and how it operates.
			</p>
			<p>
				• An establishment is the location of your food business. If it is a mobile food business, please use the location where
				it is normally stored overnight.
			</p>
